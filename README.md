## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This project leverages machine learning to build a robust **Email Spam Classifier**. It preprocesses textual data, extracts meaningful features using NLP techniques, and trains a model to predict whether an email is spam or not.

- **Dataset:** A labeled dataset of emails (spam and non-spam).  
- **Algorithms Used:** Model trained using algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or others for optimal classification.  
- **Libraries:** Python libraries such as **sklearn**, **numpy**, **pandas**, and **nltk**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Text cleaning: Remove stop words, punctuation, and special characters.  
  - Tokenization and Lemmatization for meaningful text representation.  
- **Vectorization:** Transform text data into numerical formats using **TF-IDF** or **Count Vectorizer**.  
- **Model Training:** Train with supervised learning algorithms for accurate spam detection.  
- **Real-time Prediction:** Load trained models to classify new email samples.  
- **Serialization:** Pretrained model and vectorizer saved as `.pkl` files for deployment.  
- **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score for evaluation.

## ðŸ“Š Flowchart

**1. Data Collection:**  
   Gather labeled email data (spam vs. not spam).  

**2. Preprocessing:**  
   - Text Cleaning  
   - Tokenization  
   - Lemmatization/Stemmatization  

**3. Feature Extraction:**  
   - Use **TF-IDF Vectorizer** or **Count Vectorizer** for feature generation.  

**4. Model Training:**  
   - Train a classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression) on the transformed data.  

**5. Model Evaluation:**  
   - Validate the model with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.  

**6. Model Deployment:**  
   - Save the trained model and vectorizer using pickle (`model.pkl`, `vectorizer.pkl`).
